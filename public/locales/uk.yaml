  title: Welcome to the Protein Screener (Pro55+)
  paragraph1: The Protein Screener (Pro55+) is a short (10 food items) questionnaire
    that estimates the chance on a low protein intake (<1.0 gram /per kilogram body
    weight/day) for older adults. The Protein screener (Pro55+) is developed by the
    Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (the Netherlands).
  paragraph2: You can use the Protein Screener (Pro55+) here for free. After completing
    the questions, you will immediately see the chance (0-100%) on a low protein intake.
    We consider a chance of more than {cutoff}% as a high risk on a low protein intake.
  paragraph3: To more precisely measure actual protein intake, a full nutritional
    assessment should be done by for example a dietitian.
  paragraph4: 'You can find more information on the development and validation of
    the Protein screener (Pro55+) here: {link}'
