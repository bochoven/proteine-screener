  title: Welcome to the Protein Screener (Pro55+)
  professional:
    paragraph1: The Protein Screener (Pro55+) is a short (10 food items) questionnaire
      that estimates the chance on a low protein intake (<1.0 gram /per kilogram body
      weight/day) for older adults. The Protein screener (Pro55+) is developed by the
      Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (the Netherlands).
    paragraph2: You can use the Protein Screener (Pro55+) here for free. After completing
      the questions, you will immediately see the chance (0-100%) on a low protein intake.
      We consider a chance of more than {cutoff}% as a high risk on a low protein intake.
    paragraph3: To more precisely measure actual protein intake, a full nutritional
      assessment should be done by for example a dietitian.
  client:
    paragraph1: Het eten van voldoende eiwit is belangrijk voor het behoud van spiermassa
      en botten. Vanaf de leeftijd van 50 jaar verliezen we geleidelijk spiermassa. Dit
      kunnen we beperken door voldoende eiwitinname met voeding en regelmatige
      lichaamsbeweging. Met het invullen van deze vragenlijst kunt u zelf inschatten of
      uw eiwitinname aan de lage kant is of niet. Deze vragenlijst is bedoeld voor mensen
      van 55 jaar en ouder.

      list_item_1: Een inschatting of uw eiwitinname aan de lage kant is (of niet)
      list_item_2: De hoeveel eiwit die u per dag geadviseerd wordt te eten, rekening houdend
        met uw leeftijd, lengte en gewicht
      list_item_3: Advies waar u meer informatie kunt vinden over eiwitinname
